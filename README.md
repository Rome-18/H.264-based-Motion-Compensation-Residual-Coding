H.264 based Motion Compensation Residual Coding
-------------
#### Programming Language  
Matlab

### Instruction
Run 'MAIN.m'

### Introduction
This project was designed to get the students implement a simple H.264/AVC inter-frame encoder. In this process, the student will using tools such like motion estimation, 4*4 integer discrete cosine transform, quantization and entropy coding.
